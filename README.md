This repository contain project 1 of python at AlmaBetter School, i.e. EDA. 


This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things. All personally identifying information has been removed from the data, for the shake of privacy.

I strated the analysis with with checking how many null rows I have in data, as book-keeping errors and missing values gives poor result in analysis. After taking care of null values, I dropped the duplicated.

I made a number of graph to understand:

Hotel type that have max booking.
% of booking cancellation.
ADR wrt to booking channels.
Stay of guests.
Preferred room type of guests.
segement with higher cancellation rate.
Meal preferred by guests.
Car parking space requirement.
Months with higher booking.
All the above graphs ultimately helped us to understand what kind of customers come to hotel, resource that are required on regular basis, etc.

After all the detailed analysis, I have also made a corelation chart of different columns/feature.
